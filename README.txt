This project implements standard algorithm to solve CSP problems.

Our code runs perfectly with file name as the argument in command terminal. It compiles by javac *.java
and runs by java Main [filename].

Our program utilizes the formal model of CSP and the classes for models are classified in
respective packages. The Backtrack algorithms are almost identical, only different in variable
types, meaning that the backtrack algorithm we employ can be generalized to solve any CSPs.
